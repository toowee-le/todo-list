# Todo List

My first learning project using vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

I can't recommend highly enough @gordonmzhu's [Watch and Code - Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com/) tutorial for newbie coders who want to learn vanilla JS. Gordon also teaches you to think like a programmer and how to apply this in the real world via building a todo list app.

I've improved the UI of the app further by adding CSS and amended the delete and edit JS functionalities.
